CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Teachers can ONLY be assigned to courses where their qualifications EXACTLY match the course topic
2. Never suggest assignments where qualifications don't match exactly
3. Consider weighting factors: Equality ({equality_weight}%), Continuity ({continuity_weight}%), Loyalty ({loyalty_weight}%)

WEIGHTING FACTORS EXPLAINED:
- Equality Weight: Distributes workload evenly across all qualified teachers
- Continuity Weight: Prefers consecutive lesson blocks over scattered scheduling  
- Loyalty Weight: Maintains existing teacher-course relationships when possible

SCORING FORMULA:
Final Score = (EqualityScore × {equality_weight}%) + (ContinuityScore × {continuity_weight}%) + (LoyaltyScore × {loyalty_weight}%)

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return valid JSON matching AIOptimizationResponse interface with:
- optimized_assignments: Array of assignments with weighting scores
- rationale: Clear explanation of optimization decisions
- alternatives: Alternative assignment combinations
- conflicts_resolved: Any conflicts that were addressed
- suggestions: Actionable improvement suggestions`,

CONFLICT TYPES:
- time_overlap: Teachers double-booked for same time slots
- qualification_mismatch: Teachers assigned to courses they're not qualified for
- workload_exceeded: Severe imbalance in teacher workload distribution
- availability_conflict: Assignments outside teacher working hours

RESOLUTION STRATEGIES:
1. REASSIGN: Move teacher to different course (only where qualified)
2. RESCHEDULE: Adjust time slots to eliminate overlaps
3. REBALANCE: Redistribute assignments for better workload equality
4. RECOMMEND: Suggest hiring or training for qualification gaps

CRITICAL RULES:
- Never suggest assignments without exact qualification matches
- Prioritize critical conflicts over lower severity ones
- Consider current weighting settings: Equality {equality_weight}%, Continuity {continuity_weight}%, Loyalty {loyalty_weight}%
- Provide specific, actionable solutions
